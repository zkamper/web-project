                you to its main categories</p>
            <p>When you first enter the site, you are redirected to the start page. It contains the title of the
                application, and details and information about the platform and its main objectives.</p>
            <p>The "Login" page allows user to either connect to the platform using e-mail and password, or to make
                an account on the "Register" form. To make an account they must complete the e-mail, username and
                password fields. If they are filled correctly, the account will be made and the user will be
                redirected to the "Login" page to authenticate.</p>
            <p>After logged in, the "Login" button in the navbar will be replaced by a "Profile" button which redirects
                to the user profile,
                where the user can change their password, reset their progress or find help about how to use the
                app.</p>
            <p>The "Legislation" page is separated into chapters, which each chapter pertaining to a certain
                subject. By clicking on a chapter, the user is redirected to the main articles in the law regarding
                that chapter.</p>
            <p>The "Traffic Signs" page is also separated into categories, which each category presenting its
                corresponding signs, with the image, title and description of the sign.</p>
            <p>On the "Practice" page, the user is presented with two buttons which redirect them to a page where
                they can exercise questions, or do a quiz. They can also search for a certain question. This page also
                shows a
                leaderboard of the most hardworking users.</p>
            <p>The "Exercise questions" page provides the user with a randomly chosen question from all the possible
                questions that they haven't solved yes. The user can choose either one or more responses to verify,
                or skip the question altogether. At the top, there is a progress bar where they can keep tab of the
                progress.</p>
            <p>The "Quiz" page will have a similar interface to the "Exercise questions" page, except instead of a
                progress bar it will have a timer and show how many questions are remaining. At the end it shows you
                your final score and if you have passed or failed.</p>
